                    <p>The Industry P/E is the average P/E ratio of all companies in a specific sector. It serves as a
                        benchmark to see if a specific stock is undervalued or expensive compared to its peers.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The standard valuation multiple for a group of similar businesses.</li>

                <h2>Simple Explanation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Comparison Context:</strong> You can't compare the P/E of a software company (high
                        multiple) with a cement factory (low multiple). Industry P/E ensures you are comparing apples to
                        apples.</li>
                    <li><strong>Peer Reality Check:</strong> If all banks are trading at 15 P/E and your bank is at 30
                        P/E, you need to ask: <em>"Is this bank twice as good as the others?"</em></li>
                </ul>

            <section id="analogy">
                <h2>Real-Life Analogy</h2>
                <div class="pro-insight">
                    <h3>The Neighborhood Rent Analogy</h3>
                    <p>Imagine you are looking for a 2BHK flat in a specific area like Indiranagar in Bangalore.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Average Rent in that area (Industry P/E): ₹40,000</li>
                        <li>Flat A Rent: ₹55,000 (Above average/Premium)</li>
                        <li>Flat B Rent: ₹30,000 (Below average/Bargain)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To know if Flat A is "overpriced," you <em>must</em> know the average neighborhood rent. Flat A
                        might have a pool and gym, justifying the premium. Flat B might be in poor condition, explaining
                        the low rent.</p>
