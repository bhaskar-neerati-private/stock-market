                <div class="card">
                    <p>A Mutual Fund is a financial vehicle that pools money from many investors to invest in securities
                        like stocks, bonds, and short-term debt. It is managed by professional Fund Managers.</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section id="definition">
                <h2>Why Mutual Funds?</h2>
                <div class="card">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Professional Management:</strong> You don't need to pick stocks; an expert does it
                            for you.</li>
                        <li><strong>Diversification:</strong> With just ₹500, you can own a tiny slice of 50 different
                            companies.</li>
                        <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> You can usually withdraw your money anytime (unlike real
                            estate).</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section id="nav">
                <h2>NAV (Net Asset Value)</h2>
                <p>Think of NAV as the <strong>"Share Price"</strong> of the Mutual Fund scheme.</p>
                <div class="formula">
                    NAV = (Total Assets - Total Liabilities) / Total Number of Units
                </div>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>Myth Buster:</strong> A Low NAV (₹10) does NOT mean the fund is "Cheap" compared to a High
                    NAV (₹500). NAV is irrelevant for returns. Only the <strong>growth %</strong> matters.
                </div>
            </section>

            <section id="aum">
                <h2>AUM (Assets Under Management)</h2>
                <div class="card">
                    <p>This is the total market value of the investments managed by the fund. It shows the fund's size.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Too Small (< ₹500 Cr):</strong> Risky. A few investors leaving can impact the fund.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Too Big (> ₹50,000 Cr):</strong> Hard to manage. It's difficult for the manager to
                            enter/exit stocks without moving the price.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>The Buffet vs. Cooking at Home</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Stock Trading (Cooking):</strong> You buy ingredients (Stocks), measure them, and
                            cook. If you mess up, the food is ruined. It takes time and skill.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mutual Fund (Buffet):</strong> You pay a fixed price (Investment) to a restaurant.
                            The Chef (Fund Manager) handles the shopping and cooking. You just eat (Returns).</li>
