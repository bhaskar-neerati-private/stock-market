                    <p>A Moving Average is a technical indicator that smooths out price action by filtering out the
                        "noise" of random short-term price fluctuations. It is a trend-following indicator because it is
                        based on past prices.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>SMA (Simple Moving Average):</strong> The average price over a specific number of
                            days.</li>
                        <li><strong>EMA (Exponential Moving Average):</strong> Similar to SMA but gives more weight to
                            recent prices, making it react faster.</li>

                <h2>Simple Explanation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The "Traffic" Filter:</strong> Imagine looking at the stock price as a zig-zag graph of
                        every single car on a road. The Moving Average is the average speed of all those cars. It shows
                        you the overall flow of traffic, not the movement of one single aggressive driver.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trend Compass:</strong> If the price is above the MA, the trend is UP. If below, the
                        trend is DOWN.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="pro-insight">
                    <h3>The Fitness Journey</h3>
                    <p>Imagine you weigh yourself every morning. Some days you weigh more because of water retention;
                        some days less because you missed a meal.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Daily Weight:</strong> Stock Price (Volatile/Noisy)</li>
                        <li><strong>7-Day Average:</strong> Moving Average (The <em>True</em> Trend)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If your daily weight is higher today but your 7-day average is consistently falling, you are
                        still successfully losing weight! The average tells the real story.</p>

                        <strong>20-Day EMA</strong>
                        <p>Used by short-term traders for momentum. Often called the "institutional line."</p>

                        <strong>50-Day MA</strong>
                        <p>The medium-term trend. Used to spot healthy corrective dips in an uptrend.</p>

                            Market". Pro investors rarely buy long-term if price is below this.</p>

                    <li>Price stays above MA → Buyers are in control.</li>
                    <li>MA is sloping upwards → The trend is healthy.</li>
                    <li>Price is too far above the MA → The stock is "Overextended" and might pull back soon ("Mean
                        Reversion").</li>
