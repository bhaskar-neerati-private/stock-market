                        Buying" (investing). It shows what percentage of shares traded today were actually moved into
                        investors' Demat accounts.</p>

                <h2>Simple Explanation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Trading vs. Conviction:</strong> If a stock has massive volume but very low delivery
                        (e.g., 5%), it means people are just flipping it back and forth for quick profits. If delivery
                        is high (e.g., 60%), it means serious investors are buying and holding.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quality of Move:</strong> A price rise with high delivery is a "Healthy Rise." A price
                        rise with low delivery is often an "Operator Trap."</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Real-Life Analogy</h2>

                    <h3>The Car Showroom</h3>
                    <p>Imagine a luxury car showroom.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Traded Quantity:</strong> 100 people came to test-drive the car today.</li>
                        <li><strong>Deliverable Quantity:</strong> 5 people actually paid and took the car home.</li>
                        <li><strong>Delivery %:</strong> 5%</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If 50 people took the car home (50% delivery), it means the car is a huge hit with real buyers.
                        If 100 people just "test-drive" but nobody buys, there is no real demand!</p>
