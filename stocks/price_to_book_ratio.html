                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The "Safety Buffer":</strong> If P/B is 1.0, you are buying the company's assets at
                        their exact cost in the books. If the company shuts down today, you should theoretically get
                        your money back.</li>
                    <li><strong>Asset Backing:</strong> It shows how much physical or financial "stuff" (factories,
                        cash, loans) is backing each rupee of the share price.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>The Second-Hand Car</h3>
                    <p>Imagine a used car has a "Blue Book" value of ₹2 lakh based on its model and age. This is its
                        <strong>Book Value</strong>.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you buy it for ₹2 lakh, P/B = 1.0.</li>
                        <li>If you buy it for ₹4 lakh because it was owned by a celebrity, P/B = 2.0.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In stocks, you pay a "premium" (high P/B) for strong brands, good management, or high growth

                <h3>💡 Pro Insight: The P/B-ROE Synergy</h3>
                <p>A high P/B is okay <strong>only if</strong> the ROE (Return on Equity) is also high. This shows the
                    company is generating massive profit from its assets.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High P/B + High ROE:</strong> This is a "Quality Growth" company.</li>
                    <li><strong>Low P/B + High ROE:</strong> This is a "Hidden Gem" (Rare).</li>
                    <li><strong>Low P/B + Low ROE:</strong> This is a "Value Trap" (Avoid).</li>
