                    <p>Should you invest ₹1 Lakh today (Lumpsum) or ₹10,000 for 10 months (SIP)? This is the most common
                        dilemma.</p>

            <section id="sip">
                <h2>SIP (Systematic Investment Plan)</h2>
                <p>You give a standing instruction to your bank to deduct a fixed amount (e.g., ₹5000) on a fixed date
                    (e.g., 5th) every month.</p>
                <div class="card" style="border-top: 5px solid var(--success);">
                    <h3>Why SIP is Superior for Beginners</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Discipline:</strong> You save before you spend.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Timing:</strong> You don't care if the market is High or Low. You buy in both.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Psychology:</strong> When markets crash, you are happy because your SIP buys *more*
                            units.</li>
                    </ul>

            <section id="rca">
                <h2>The Math: Rupee Cost Averaging</h2>
                <p>This is the secret sauce of SIPs.</p>
                <div class="formula">
                    High Price = Buy Fewer Units.<br>
                    Low Price = Buy More Units.<br>
                    Average Cost = Lower than Market Price!
                </div>
                <p>Because you buy <strong>more</strong> when the market is down, your average cost of buying drops
                    automatically. You don't need to predict anything.</p>

                <h2>When does Lumpsum work?</h2>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>Warning:</strong> Lumpsum is risky. If you invest ₹1 Lakh today and the market falls 10%
                    tomorrow, your portfolio is instantly red. Use Lumpsum ONLY when markets has <strong>crashed
                        significantly</strong> (correction of >20%).

                <div class="checklist">
                    <li><strong>Salary/Monthly Income?</strong> → Always SIP.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bonus/Windfall/Property Sale?</strong> → Don't do Lumpsum. Put it in a Liquid Fund and
                        do an <strong>STP (Systematic Transfer Plan)</strong> into Equity over 6-12 months. This spreads
                        your risk.</li>
