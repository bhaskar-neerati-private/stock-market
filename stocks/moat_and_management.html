                    <p>Ratios tell you what happened in the <strong>past</strong>. The "Moat" and "Management" tell you
                        what will happen in the <strong>future</strong>. This is the heart of qualitative analysis.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <p>An Economic Moat is a distinct advantage that a company has over its competitors which allows it
                        to protect its market share and profitability long-term.</p>
                    <p><em>Term coined by Warren Buffett.</em></p>

                        <strong>Switching Costs</strong>
                        <p>Once you use Microsoft Windows or SAP, it's very painful and expensive to switch to something
                            else. Users stay even if prices rise.</p>

                    <h3>Protecting the Wealth</h3>
                    <p>Imagine the business is a <strong>Castle</strong> and the Profit is the gold inside.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Competitors are the <strong>Enemy Army</strong> trying to steal your gold.</li>
                        <li>The <strong>Moat</strong> is the deep water surrounding the castle.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The wider the moat, the harder it is for competitors to enter and drive down your profits. A
                        business with NO moat will eventually see its profits disappear to competition.</p>

                <h2>Evaluating Management (The Jockey)</h2>
                <p>If the company is the Horse, management is the <strong>Jockey</strong>. Even a great horse can lose
                    with a bad jockey.</p>
                <ul class="checklist">
                    <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Are they honest? Check for legal cases or "creative" accounting.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Salary:</strong> Is the CEO taking 20% of the profit as salary? (Red Flag).</li>
                    <li><strong>Capital Allocation:</strong> Do they waste money on fancy offices, or do they buy back
                        shares and pay dividends?</li>
                    <li><strong>Skin in the Game:</strong> Do they own a large chunk of the company? (Promoter holding).
