                    <p>Support and Resistance are the most basic and powerful concepts in technical analysis. They
                        represent specific price levels where large groups of buyers or sellers tend to enter the
                        market.</p>

                <h2>Simple Explanation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Market Memory:</strong> If a stock fell to ₹100 and then rose to ₹150, the next time it
                        falls back to ₹100, everyone remembers: <em>"Last time it bounced here! It's cheap!"</em> This
                        group memory creates a Support zone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Zones, Not Lines:</strong> Think of them as thick elastic bands, not thin laser lines.
                        The price can briefly dip through them before bouncing.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>The Bouncing Ball</h3>
                    <p>Imagine you are in a house and you drop a ball.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The Floor:</strong> Acts as Support. The ball hits it and bounces back up.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Ceiling:</strong> Acts as Resistance. If you throw the ball up, it hits the
                            ceiling and falls back down.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you throw the ball hard enough to <strong>break the ceiling</strong>, you reach the second
                        floor. Now, the <em>old ceiling</em> becomes your <em>new floor</em>.</p>

                <h3>💡 Pro Insight: The Reversal (Polarity)</h3>
                <p>One of the most powerful trade setups is when <strong>Resistance becomes Support</strong>. After a
                    stock breaks out above a major resistance level, it often comes back to "retest" that same level. If
                    it bounces, that level is now strong Support.</p>
