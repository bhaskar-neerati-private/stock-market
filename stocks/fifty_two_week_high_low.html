                    <p>The 52-week high/low is the highest and lowest price at which a security has traded during the
                        last year. It is one of the most widely watched psychological markers by both traders and
                        investors.</p>

                <h2>Simple Explanation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The "Range" Bounds:</strong> It tells you where the stock usually lives. If a stock is
                        at its 52-week high, it's breaking out of its comfort zone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Momentum Indicator:</strong> Stocks hitting 52-week highs often continue to go higher
                        because "strength breeds strength." Stocks at 52-week lows are often in deep trouble.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Real-Life Analogy</h2>
                <div class="pro-insight">
                    <h3>The High Jump Athlete</h3>
                    <p>Imagine an athlete trying to break their personal best for the year.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>52-Week High:</strong> Their highest jump this year. If they break this record, they
                            are in peak form and confidence is through the roof.</li>
                        <li><strong>52-Week Low:</strong> Their worst performance. If they keep hitting this, they might
                            be injured or have lost their edge.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Investors buy stocks near 52-week highs because it proves the business is winning. Buying at
                        52-week lows is like betting on a sick athlete—risky!</p>

                        <strong>Near Highs</strong>
                        <p>Confidence is high. No "bag-holders" (people who bought higher) are left to sell and stop the
                            price. This creates "Blue Sky" territory.</p>

                        <strong>Near Lows</strong>
                        <p>Fear is high. Every time the price tries to bounce, people who bought higher sell just to
                            "get their money back," pushing the price down again.</p>
